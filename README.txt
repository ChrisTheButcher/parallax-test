A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/32bitkid/pen/EaQvOr.

 A small experiment, implemented in angular to do parallax mouse panning.

The composite image on top is a single image that I made in photoshop. The bottom, each layer of the image was separated and saved independently. As the mouse moves, it transforms each layer independently giving the illusion of depth...

Give this a heart if you want to write up a blog post explaining more about how it works!

Thanks!!!
